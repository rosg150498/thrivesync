## Website Design Choices

### Colours

The selection of colour choices plays a pivotal role in shaping the visual identity and functionality of the virtual event system. Each colour, carefully chosen from a palette of #2ECC71, #185D8B, #FAF9F9, and #221B1C, serves a specific purpose in enhancing the overall visibility and user experience. These thoughtfully curated hues not only evoke emotions and convey professionalism but also ensure that content is accessible and engagement is encouraged. In this comprehensive colour scheme, the aim is to create an environment where users can seamlessly navigate, access information, and interact with the platform while enjoying an aesthetically pleasing and visually engaging experience.

I have decided upon the colour shade of #185D8B, a profound and confident deep blue hue, specifically allocated to our platform's navigation bar, pivotal headings and footer. This deliberate choice stems from its ability to evoke a sense of trustworthiness and professionalism, qualities that are paramount in our role as facilitators of users' personal development journeys. By employing this hue strategically, we aim to provide clear and highly visible navigation cues, ensuring that users can effortlessly explore the richness of our platform's content with utmost clarity.

I have chosen upon the incorporation of #2ECC71, a lively and attention-grabbing green hue, primarily designated for our platform's call-to-action buttons and essential interactive elements. This decision stems from its ability to capture the user's attention and prompt them to take vital actions, such as event registration, thus ensuring their clear visibility and fostering active engagement with our platform.

I have decided upon the utilization of #FAF9F9, a near-white shade, to serve as the background color for the virtual platform, promoting a clean and easily accessible environment. This choice has been made with the intention of enhancing the contrast between text and content, thereby ensuring that users can effortlessly read and engage with the array of offerings on our platform.

I've selected the colour shade of #221B1C, a deep charcoal hue, for presenting textual content on lighter backgrounds. This selection is based on its capacity to provide high contrast, guaranteeing exceptional legibility and effectiveness in conveying information with utmost clarity.

### Fonts

I conducted extensive experimentation with a diverse range of fonts available on the Google Fonts website. This exploration aimed to identify a typeface that I consider highly fitting for the single-page website dedicated to the virtual personal development event platform. After thorough assessment and testing, I selected typefaces that I believe perfectly embodies the platform's essence and objectives.

Utilizing Open Sans as the primary body text font for the event platform is justified by its exceptional readability, versatile design, and widespread compatibility. Open Sans offers a balanced and contemporary typographic style that ensures users can comfortably engage with content, promoting comprehension and reducing visual fatigue. Its diverse range of font weights allows for effective typographic hierarchy, creating structured and visually appealing layouts. Being a web-safe font with extensive cross-browser and cross-device support, Open Sans guarantees consistent and reliable text rendering, providing a seamless and accessible experience to a broad audience. Furthermore, its neutrality and adaptability make it a trusted choice for conveying professional and growth-oriented content, contributing to a positive and user-friendly platform environment.

I have chosen to use the Lato typeface exclusively for headings on the virtual personal development event platform. Lato's distinctive design and readability make it an ideal choice for capturing users' attention and providing a clear typographic hierarchy. Its versatile range of font weights and styles allows for flexibility in presenting content while maintaining a cohesive and professional visual identity. This selection aligns seamlessly with the platform's goal of offering a polished and engaging user experience.

<hr>

### Icons

In the process of developing my personal development event platform, I will integrate icons sourced from the Flat Icon website (https://www.flaticon.com/). The incorporation of visual icons serves a dual purpose in enhancing both the aesthetics and functionality of the platform. Icons provide intuitive visual cues that simplify navigation, making it easier for users to identify and access specific sections and features. Additionally, they add a layer of visual appeal and engagement, contributing to an overall user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing experience. By strategically using icons, I aim to create a platform that not only guides users efficiently but also immerses them in a visually engaging and informative journey of personal development.
